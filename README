The program creates a boggle game using two main classes,
the boggle_gui class and the boggle_model class while the program itself is run by the boggle_controller class.
The boggle_gui is using tkinter library and acts as the frontend of the project (displays the game and actions).
The boggle_model calculates and processes the different computations of the program and acts as the backend.

The game itself is about a board of random letter and the player needs to find adjacent letters that construct words.
For more details about the game itself read here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boggle

To run the game you can double click the 'run' file or if you prefer, 
you can use the command line and type 'python .\boggle.py'.

Enjoy!
